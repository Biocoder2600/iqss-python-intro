## Workshop Exercises

### Part 1: Introduction

 1-1. Complete the one-minute poll at [bit.ly/iqss106](http://bit.ly/iqss106)


### Part 2: Getting the Tools

 2-1. After installing Python, open the Python IDE (such as Spyder or IDLE) on your machine.  Type the following into the interpreter:
    ```python
    print('Hello, world.')
    ```

 2-2. Create a file named *hello.py*.  You will add code to this script throughout Parts 2 and 3 of the workshop. On the first two lines, type the following:
    ```
    # My first Python script
    print('Hello, world.')
    ```
    Save the script and run it from the IDE.

### Part 3: Programming Basics
 3.1. The following code uses operators that have special meanings in Python.  Add the following statements to your *hello.py* script.  Predict what the output will be before running the script.

    |Statement| Prediction|
    |:---|:---|
    |`movie = 'Rogue One'`|N/A|
    |`print(movie)`||
    |`i = 1`||
    |`i += 1`||
    |`print(i)`||
    |`print('A' + 'B')`||
    |`print('me'*3)`||
    |`print('a' == 'a')`||
    |`print('a' == 1)`||
    |`print(5 != 25/5)`||

 3.2. The following code demonstrates some of the different ways to reference the elements of a sequence.  Add the following statements to your *hello.py* script. Predict what the output will be before running the script.

    |Statement| Prediction|
    |:---|:---|
    |`mystring = 'happy'`N/A|
    |`print(mystring[0])`||
    |`print(mystring[2:4])`||
    |`mylist = ['Leia', 'Rey', 'Maz']`|N/A|
    |`print(mylist[-1])`||
    |`mydict = {'name': 'Kylo', 'side': 'dark'}`|N/A|
    |`print(mydict['name'])`||
